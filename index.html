My name is Viktor Kim and I came here from Kyrgyzstan, it is a small country in Central Asia which is surrounded by high mountains. Many people here don't even know about this beautiful place, so I can tell you more about it later.

If we talk about me then I am a very friendly person, it is absolutely no big problem to find common language with me and have fun. I am a very versatile person, I have a lot of different interesting hobbies, from computer games to extreme sports and nature. I really like the outdoors, hiking in the mountains and walking in the forests are my favorite, so we can explore the local nature together.

I really like to try different cuisines from all over the world and I even know how to cook a little bit. I really like Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese cuisine, so we can also eat somewhere together, and maybe even find something new.

Before Canada, I studied civil engineering in the Czech Republic, but realized that this is absolutely not what I wanted to do in the future, so I decided to change the program related to design and development, as I have recently become very passionate about it. And I took two additional courses in web design web development in my home country, so I have a little experience in this area.
